## Course Overview
Data scientists and engineers increasingly have access to a powerful and broad range of systems
they use to conduct big data analysis and machine learning at scale: from databases, large-scale
analytics to distributed machine learning frameworks. \\
\\
The goal of this class is to provide data scientists and engineers that work with big data a better
understanding of the foundations of how the systems they will be using are built. It will also
give them a better understanding of the real-world performance, availability and scalability
challenges when using and deploying these systems at scale. In the course we will cover
foundational ideas in designing these systems, while focusing on specific popular systems that
students are likely to encounter at work or when doing research. The class will include some
written homework and programming assignments. One of the programming assignments will be
done in pairs, and the rest will be done individually.
In this course we will answer the following questions:
<ul>
  <li>How are popular big data systems designed and architected?</li>
  <li>How to think about performance, scale and reliability of big data systems?</li>
  <li>How do they remain available and not lose data despite frequent server and
hardware failures?</li>
  <li>How to reason about issues like security, privacy and data quality when
conducting analysis on large data sets?</li>
</ul>

## Collaboration/Copying Policy
Programming assignment 1 and the written assignments will be done alone. Programming assignment 2 will be done in pairs. You may not copy answers and code. We will enforce this policy when checking the assignments (we use a code similarity system).
